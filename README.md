    <h1>LogSans - Companion Library for LogSnag</h1>
	<p>LogSans Client - LogSans is a companion library for <a href="https://logsnag.com">LogSnag</a>. LogSans enables notification for events that have NOT happened in a pre-defined frequency.</p>
	<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/logsans"><img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/logsans" alt="NPM Version"></a>

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save logsans
```

## Usage

### Import Library

```js
const {LogSnag} = require("logsans")
```


ðŸ•º Notice how we've named the variable **LogSnag** (instead of the LogSans). This allows you to not have to change your exsiting code if you have already implemented LogSnag. ðŸ˜Ž


### Initialize Client

```js
const logsnag = new LogSnag(process.env.YOUR_LOG_SNAG_TOKEN);
```

### Publish Event & Track Event

```js
logsnag.publish({
    project: "your-logsnag-project",
    channel: "your-logsnag-channel",
    event: "Your logsnag event",
    icon: "ðŸŽ‰",
    notify: true,
    logsans: true /* This property is only needed if you want LogSans to be able to notify you when this event does NOT happen. */
});
```

This will do two things:
1. âœ… It publishes your event to LogSnag the LogSnag library normally does
2. âœ… Tracks your event on LogSans so that LogSans can alert you when the event does NOT happen based on your desired freqency (more on that below)

### Tell LogSans When to Check
Now that you are tracking your events, it is time to tell LogSans how often to check for it.

To do that, user the **Create Recurring Check** endpoint here:

```curl
curl --location --request PUT 'https://logsans-api.twostep.co/api/check/create' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": "YOUR-LOGSNAG-TOKEN",
    "project": "your-logsnag-project",
    "channel": "your-logsnag-channel",
    "event": "Your logsnag event",
    "frequency" : 5 /* in minutes */
}'
```
More Documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10930387/Uz5MFEMj

Once you create a **Recurring Check**, LogSans alert you if it has not detected your event in the timeframe set by the **frequency** property.

##### For Example
If **frequency** is set to 30 (minutes), LogSans will trigger a LogSnag event telling you that it has not seen that event in the last 30 minutes.
